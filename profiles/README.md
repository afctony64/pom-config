# Profiles (Deprecated)

Mode-based profiles have been removed. Service discovery is dynamic and
shared configuration is defined in `shared-config.env`.

Do not add `home.env`, `travel.env`, or `ooo.env` files back into this
directory.

Use workload profiles (see `workload-profiles.yml`) for performance tuning.
