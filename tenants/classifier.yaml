# Global Classifier Tenant
# Issue #224: Dedicated tenant for Vec classification seed data
#
# This tenant holds ONLY seed data (synthetic training data) for vector classification.
# Production tenants set `classifier_tenant: classifier` to query seeds from here.
#
# Benefits:
# - Clear separation of seeds from production data
# - Quality monitoring for classifier data
# - Version control for seeds independent of production
# - Cleaner queries (no seed=true filtering needed)
