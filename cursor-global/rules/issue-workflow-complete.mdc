# Issue Workflow - Fix AND Close

When working on GitHub issues, you MUST complete the full cycle:

## The Problem
You frequently fix issues but forget to close them. This leaves stale issues open.

## Required Workflow

### 1. When Fixing an Issue
After implementing a fix:
```bash
# Commit with closing keyword
git commit -m "fix: description (fixes #123)"

# If on feature branch, manually close
gh issue close 123 --repo owner/repo --comment "Fixed in commit abc123"
```

### 2. When User Says "Issue is Done"
IMMEDIATELY close it:
```bash
gh issue close <number> --repo afctony64/<repo> --comment "Resolved"
```

### 3. When Reviewing Open Issues
For each issue, determine:
- **Needs fix**: Fix it, then close it
- **Already fixed**: Close with reference to fix
- **Not this repo**: Transfer with `gh issue transfer`
- **Question/RFC**: Answer and close, or leave open if discussion needed

## Anti-Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS)
```
❌ Fix code → Move to next task (FORGOT TO CLOSE)
❌ User says "it's done" → Just acknowledge (FORGOT TO CLOSE)
❌ Review issues → List them but don't close resolved ones
```

## Correct Pattern
```
✅ Fix code → Commit → Close issue → Verify closed
✅ User says "it's done" → Close immediately → Confirm closed
✅ Review issues → Close all resolved ones → Report remaining
```

## Verification
After closing, always verify:
```bash
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --state open --limit 5
```
