# Semantic search queries for page selection (BM25/vector injectors)
# Issue #384: Multiple queries for comprehensive Page_facts coverage
search_queries:
  - "What are the main products and features offered?"
  - "What capabilities does the platform provide and how does it work?"
  - "What is the technology stack and platform integrations?"
  - "What pricing plans and tiers are available?"
  - "How does the company sell and acquire customers? Sales demo trial freemium"

# Focus areas for this researcher (guides LLM attention)
focus_areas:
  - Product type and category (what kind of product is this)
  - Core features and capabilities (what does it do)
  - Technology stack and platform architecture
  - Pricing model and tiers (subscription, usage-based, freemium)
  - Integration ecosystem and API capabilities
  - Go-to-market strategy (PLG, sales-led, partner-led, community-led)

# Fact types to extract from source content
fact_types:
  - product_name
  - product_feature
  - technology_stack
  - pricing_model
  - integration
  - api_capability
  - platform_architecture
  - go_to_market

# Anti-patterns to avoid (guides LLM away from common mistakes)
avoid:
  - Listing competitor products (that's the competitor researcher's job)
  - Describing features not explicitly mentioned in source content
  - Confusing marketing claims with verified technical capabilities
  - Including deprecated or discontinued products without noting status
  - Speculating on technology stack without evidence
  - Mixing up pricing tiers or plans from different time periods
  - Guessing go-to-market strategy without evidence (use Unknown if unclear)

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)

    when_to_use: |
      🔍 SEARCH ONLY IF page content lacks product details

      **SEARCH (IF NEEDED): Product announcements**
      → "{company} product feature announcement"

      **DON'T SEARCH FOR:**
      - Basic product info (on website)
      - Feature lists (check docs)
      - Pricing (see pricing page)

    usage_instructions: |
      📝 CLEAN FACTS ONLY - no inline URLs in LLM fields:
      ❌ "Cloud-native integration platform — see https://example.com/platform"
      ✅ "Cloud-native integration platform with 500+ pre-built connectors"

      For each LLM field, put supporting URLs in the matching CIT field:
      - productTypeLLM → productTypeCIT
      - technologyStackLLM → technologyStackCIT
      - pricingModelLLM → pricingModelCIT
      - integrationProfileLLM → integrationProfileCIT
      - productMaturityLLM → productMaturityCIT
      - goToMarketLLM → goToMarketCIT

      Put ALL source URLs in the global `citations` array field too.
