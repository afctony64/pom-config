researcher_identity:
  title: Senior Social Intelligence Analyst
  mission: Provide structured social media analysis with concise, actionable insights
  ecosystem_role: Social-focused researcher delivering JSON-formatted intelligence
  core_competencies:
  - 'Platform Presence: Actual social accounts, technical implementation, engagement metrics'
  - 'Content Strategy: Messaging themes, social proof, brand positioning'
  - 'Community Engagement: Community features, engagement approach, relationship building'
  - 'Social Maturity: Strategic vs. tactical social media usage'

# Semantic search queries for page selection (page_facts_vector injector)
# NOTE: Queries phrased as ANSWER DESCRIPTIONS, not questions
# Questions match question-like patterns in legal/boilerplate content
# Answer descriptions match actual social/community content
search_queries:
  - "LinkedIn Twitter GitHub YouTube Instagram TikTok"
  - "community Slack Discord forum developer resources"
  - "follow us connect social media blog podcast"

# BM25 keyword queries - used by page_facts_vector injector (supplements vector)
keyword_queries:
  - "linkedin"
  - "github"
  - "youtube"
  - "discord"
  - "slack"
  - "community"

# URL boost patterns - used by page_facts_vector injector
url_boost_patterns:
  - "/community"
  - "/developers"
  - "/blog"
  - "/podcast"

# page_facts_vector tuning (declarative injector behavior)
# Social cares about footer/header link chunks that may include "follow us on".
page_facts_vector_boilerplate_exclude_patterns:
  - "follow us on"
  - "let's connect"

# Split the broad multi-platform query into narrower probes (entity-agnostic).
# The original query remains in search_queries for cached-vector usage.
page_facts_vector_extra_search_queries_max: 4
page_facts_vector_extra_search_queries:
  - "LinkedIn company page profile"
  - "GitHub organization repositories"
  - "YouTube channel videos"
  - "Twitter X account"

# Focus areas for this researcher (prompt guidance, not used by injector)
focus_areas:
  - Social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc.)
  - Community presence (Slack, Discord, forums)
  - Developer community (GitHub, Stack Overflow)
  - Content channels (blog, podcast, YouTube)
  - Social engagement and follower metrics

# Fact types to extract from source content
# Used by ContextExecutor for fact-type prioritization when preparing context.
fact_types:
  - social_platform
  - social_account
  - community_channel
  - developer_resource
  - content_channel
  - engagement_metric

# Anti-patterns to avoid (guides LLM away from common mistakes)
avoid:
  - Including clearly inactive or abandoned social accounts (no posts for years)
  - Confusing personal founder accounts with official company accounts
  - Fabricating follower counts or engagement metrics not in sources
  - Including unrelated fan accounts or unofficial community pages as official
  # NOTE: DO extract platform presence from page content (footer links, share buttons,
  # community mentions). If page content references github, slack, blog - include them.

# 🌐 DATA INJECTION: Pre-enriched Domain fields (from enrichers)
# NOTE: This is a separate data injector (digital_presence), not page_facts_vector.
# The digital_presence injector provides already-discovered social/tech data
# from the Domain record, so the AI doesn't need to rediscover it via search.
# Uses tools_config format for pom-core merge compatibility

    inject_as: digitalPresence
    tag: "digital"  # Fetch fields tagged with "digital" (social, tech, platform presence)

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)
