# Semantic search query for page selection (BM25/vector injectors)

# The digital_presence injector provides already-discovered social/tech data
# from the Domain record, so the AI doesn't need to rediscover it via search.

  injectors:
    - injector_template: digital_presence
      template_vars:
        domain: "{{ (record.get('properties') or record).get('domain', record.get('domain', '')) }}"
        tag: "digital"  # Fetch fields tagged with "digital" (social, tech, platform presence)
        inject_as: "digitalPresence"

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)
