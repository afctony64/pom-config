      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 3 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ DO NOT search every source - pick 2-3 most relevant!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Funding data**
      → "{company} crunchbase pitchbook funding investors"
      (Crunchbase + PitchBook in ONE search - most comprehensive)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (REQUIRED): Company press releases**
      → "site:{company_domain} funding announcement press release"
      (Company's own press pages - may have latest funding not yet on Crunchbase)
      
      **SEARCH #3 (IF NEEDED): Revenue/metrics**
      → "{company} revenue ARR valuation"
      (Only if funding search didn't include revenue)
      
      **SEARCH #4 (IF NEEDED): Recent news**
      → "{company} funding announcement 2024"
      (Only for recent developments not in Crunchbase)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - Total funding amount
      - Key investors (2-3 names)
      - Funding stage
      - Revenue estimate (if available)
      
    recommended_searches:
      # ONE combined search covers most needs:
      primary: "{company_name} crunchbase pitchbook funding investors valuation"
      
      # Only if primary didn't have revenue:
      revenue: "{company_name} revenue ARR annual growth owler"
      
      # Only for very recent news:
      news: "{company_name} funding announcement 2024 series"
