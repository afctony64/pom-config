  hybrid_alpha: 0.3  # BM25-heavy for specific financial terms (funding, investors, Series A)

      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 4 SEARCHES):

      ⚠️ DO NOT search every source - pick 2-4 most relevant!

      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Funding data**
      → "{company} crunchbase pitchbook funding investors"
      (Crunchbase + PitchBook in ONE search - most comprehensive)

      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Revenue/metrics**
      → "{company} revenue ARR valuation"
      (Only if funding search didn't include revenue)

      **SEARCH #3 (IF NEEDED): Recent news**
      → "{company} funding announcement 2024"
      (Only for recent developments not in Crunchbase)

      **STOP after finding:**
      - Total funding amount
      - Key investors (2-3 names)
      - Funding stage
      - Revenue estimate (if available)

    recommended_searches:
      # ONE combined search covers most needs:
      primary: "{company_name} crunchbase pitchbook funding investors valuation"

      # Only if primary didn't have revenue:
      revenue: "{company_name} revenue ARR annual growth owler"

      # Only for very recent news:
      news: "{company_name} funding announcement 2024 series"
