# CONDITIONAL FIELD UPDATES - entityName Protection Rules
# ============================================================================
# entityName requires special handling:
# - PRESERVE if existing value looks like a clean company name
# - EXTRACT CLEAN if existing value is missing, empty, or looks like a web title
#
# This prevents overwriting good Source data while still allowing discovery
# ============================================================================

# Focus areas for this researcher (guides LLM attention)
focus_areas:
  - "entityName: CRITICAL - Check EXISTING value FIRST. If it looks like a clean company name (e.g., 'Stripe', 'Acme Corp'), PRESERVE IT and output the same value. Only extract a NEW name if: (1) empty/null, (2) looks like web title with |, -, ::, (3) is just 'Home', 'Welcome', or error text, (4) matches the domain exactly (e.g., 'example.com')"
  - Founded year (look for "Founded in", "Established", "Since", "Launched", first funding round)
  - Headquarters location (city, state/region, country - ISO 2-letter code)
  - Contact information (email, phone, street address)
  - ALWAYS set domain_research=true to mark this entity as researched

# Fact types to extract from source content
fact_types:
  - entity_name
  - founded_year
  - headquarters
  - country
  - email
  - phone
  - address

# Avoid patterns for this researcher
avoid:
  - "OVERWRITING CLEAN entityName: If existing entityName looks like a proper company name (no pipes |, no dashes with spaces ' - ', not 'Home'), KEEP IT and output the existing value"
  - Using page title as entity name (often includes taglines, separators like | or -)
  - Extracting names that contain | (pipe), :: (double colon), or ' - ' (spaced dash) - these are web title patterns
  - Outputting entityName as just the domain (e.g., 'example.com') - find the actual company name
  - Guessing founded year without evidence (use 0 if not found)
  - Confusing regional offices with headquarters
  - Extracting marketing taglines as company names
