    when_to_use: |
      ONLY USE BRAVE SEARCH IF PAGE CONTENT IS MISSING KEY FIELDS:
      
      1. FIRST: Extract all fields from the provided page facts
      2. THEN: If foundedYear OR headquarters is STILL MISSING, do ONE search:
      
      Search query: "{company_name} founded year headquarters location"
      
      EXAMPLE FLOW:
      - Page facts show: entityName="Acme Corp", country="US", but NO foundedYear
      - Search: "Acme Corp founded year headquarters location"
      - Extract: foundedYear=2015, headquarters="San Francisco, CA"
      
      DO NOT SEARCH IF:
      - All identity fields are already found in page content
      - Only minor fields like phone/email are missing (not worth a search)
