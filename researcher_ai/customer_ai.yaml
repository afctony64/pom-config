      🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      - keyCustomers: NAMES ONLY (e.g., ["Microsoft", "Acme Corp"]) - NO case study text!
      - caseStudies: PARALLEL to keyCustomers - one summary per customer at same index
      - customerIndustries: Industries served
      - customerSegments: Enterprise, SMB, mid-market
      
      ⚠️ CRITICAL PARALLEL ARRAY ALIGNMENT:
      keyCustomers[0] = "Microsoft" → caseStudies[0] = "Microsoft reduced costs by 40%..."
      keyCustomers[1] = "Acme Corp" → caseStudies[1] = "Acme improved efficiency..."
