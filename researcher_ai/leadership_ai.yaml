      ⚠️ Company "About Us" often has basic info - only search for GAPS!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (IF NEEDED): Leadership team overview**
      → "{company} CEO founders leadership team linkedin"
      (Gets executives + backgrounds in one search)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Board/advisors**
      → "{company} board of directors investors advisors"
      (Only if page content missing board info)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - CEO/founder names + brief background
      - Key executives (CTO, CFO, etc.)
      - Board members (if any)

      🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      - keyExecutives: List actual names found with roles
      - executiveBackgrounds: Brief career history per executive
      - boardMembers: Include investor board seats
      - Use parallel arrays for executives/roles/backgrounds
      
      🚨 CRITICAL: NAMES ARE REQUIRED FOR PARALLEL ARRAYS
      - ONLY include executives in keyExecutives if you have an ACTUAL NAME
      - Do NOT add entries like "CFO (name not disclosed)" or "Head of Engineering (unknown)"
      - If you cannot find a person's name, DO NOT add them to the array
      - Empty arrays are VALID - better than placeholder/inferred entries
      - The parallel arrays (executiveRoles, executiveBackgrounds, etc.) must ONLY 
        have entries that correspond to NAMED executives in keyExecutives
