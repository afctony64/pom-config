      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 3 SEARCHES):

      ⚠️ Company "About Us" often has basic info - only search for GAPS!

      **SEARCH #1 (IF NEEDED): Leadership team + LinkedIn profiles**
      → "{company} CEO founders leadership team linkedin"
      (Gets executives + backgrounds + LinkedIn profile URLs in one search)

      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Employee count / company size**
      → "{company} linkedin employees headcount company size"
      (Only if page content is missing employee count)

      **SEARCH #3 (IF NEEDED): Board/advisors**
      → "{company} board of directors investors advisors"
      (Only if page content missing board info)

      **EXTRACT FROM RESULTS:**
      - Executive names + roles
      - LinkedIn profile URLs (format: linkedin.com/in/username)
      - Background information (previous companies, education)
      - Tenure information
      - Employee count (from LinkedIn company page or news articles)

      **STOP after finding:**
      - CEO/founder names + brief background
      - Key executives (CTO, CFO, etc.)
      - LinkedIn URLs for executives (populate executiveLinkedIn array)
      - Board members (if any)
      - Employee count (populate employeeCount field)

    recommended_searches:
      # Combined leadership + LinkedIn search:
      primary: "{company_name} CEO founders leadership team executives linkedin profiles"

      # Employee headcount search:
      headcount: "{company_name} linkedin employees headcount company size"

      # Only if board info missing:
      board: "{company_name} board of directors investors advisors"
# page_categories_of_interest: REMOVED - not implemented in pom-core (dead code)
