      (Gets executives + backgrounds + LinkedIn profile URLs in one search)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Employee count / company size**
      → "{company} linkedin employees headcount company size"
      (Only if page content is missing employee count)
      
      **SEARCH #3 (IF NEEDED): Board/advisors**
      → "{company} board of directors investors advisors"
      (Only if page content missing board info)
