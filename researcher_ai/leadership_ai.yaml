      → "{company} CEO founders leadership team linkedin"
      (Gets executives + backgrounds + LinkedIn profile URLs in one search)

      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Employee count / company size**
      → "{company} linkedin employees headcount company size"
      (Only if page content is missing employee count)

      **SEARCH #3 (IF NEEDED): Board/advisors**
      → "{company} board of directors investors advisors"
      (Only if page content missing board info)

      **EXTRACT FROM RESULTS:**
      - Executive names + roles

      - Background information (previous companies, education)
