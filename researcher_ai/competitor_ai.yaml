      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators
      
    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"
      
      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"
