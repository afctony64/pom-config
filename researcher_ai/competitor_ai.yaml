# Semantic search queries for page selection (page_facts_vector injector)
# Issue #384: Multiple queries for comprehensive Page_facts coverage
# NOTE: Queries phrased as ANSWER DESCRIPTIONS, not questions
# Questions match question-like patterns in legal/boilerplate content
# Answer descriptions match actual competitor content
search_queries:
  - "competitor alternative vs comparison better than unlike"
  - "G2 Capterra ranking review leader challenger market position"
  - "pricing feature advantage differentiator unique selling"

# BM25 keyword queries - used by page_facts_vector injector (supplements vector)
keyword_queries:
  - "alternatives"
  - "competitors"
  - "comparison"
  - "compare"
  - "g2"

# Focus areas for this researcher (prompt guidance, not used by injector)
focus_areas:
  - "CRITICAL: Extract EVERY competitor from /how-we-compare or comparison pages - do NOT skip any"
  - "Include ALL companies with dedicated comparison pages (Paragon, Boomi, Cyclr, Pandium, Appmixer, N8n, Tray, Workato, Zapier, etc.)"
  - "Aim for 8-15 competitors - include smaller/niche players, not just market leaders"
  - Competitive advantages vs each competitor (what THIS company does better)
  - Competitive gaps vs each competitor (where competitors are stronger)
  - Market positioning (leader, challenger, niche player)
  - Awards and accolades (G2, Capterra rankings, certifications)

# Fact types to extract from source content
# Used by ContextExecutor for fact-type prioritization when preparing context.
fact_types:
  - competitor_name
  - competitive_advantage
  - competitive_gap
  - market_position
  - pricing_comparison
  - feature_comparison
  - award_or_ranking

# Anti-patterns to avoid (guides LLM away from common mistakes)
avoid:
  - Comparing to unrelated companies in completely different markets
  - Speculating on competitor strategy without evidence from sources
  - Including companies that serve different customer segments entirely
  - Using the company's own biased comparison pages as sole source
  - Confusing technology partners with competitors

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)

      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):

      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!

      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)

      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)

      **STOP after finding:**
      - All key competitors mentioned
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators

    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"

      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"
