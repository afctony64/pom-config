# Semantic search queries for page selection (BM25/vector injectors)
# Issue #384: Multiple queries for comprehensive Page_facts coverage
search_queries:
  - "How does this product compare to competitors?"
  - "What alternatives exist and what differentiates them?"
  - "What customer reviews and market positioning exist?"

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)
tools:
  - brave_search  # Web search for competitor analysis, G2/Capterra reviews

  brave_search:

    tool_choice: required  # Competitor data from G2/Capterra is essential (company pages are biased)
    when_to_use: |
      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators
      
    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"
      
      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"

      🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      - Return ALL responses as valid JSON
      - Use arrays for lists
      - Keep descriptions concise (50-100 chars max)
      - Focus on facts, not prose
      - Maximum 5 items per category
      
  array_requirements:
    priority: critical
    usage_instructions: |
      📊 ARRAY FIELD REQUIREMENTS (schema has full definitions):
      
      **Entity-Level Arrays** (text[] without parallel_to):
      - Describe THIS entity's overall competitive position
      - Populate 3-5 items each - read field descriptions from schema
      - These are NOT per-competitor, they're about THIS entity overall
      
      **Parallel Arrays** (text[] with parallel_to relationship):
      - Per-competitor data - one value per competitor identified
      - ALL parallel arrays MUST have IDENTICAL length
      - Index alignment: [i] in one array = [i] in all others
      - Use "Not disclosed" if data unavailable to maintain alignment
      
      ⚠️ DO NOT leave array fields empty - they are key outputs!
      ⚠️ For competitor domains, use web search if not found in pageData
      
  citation_format:
    priority: critical
    usage_instructions: |
      📎 CITATION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      
      **CLEAN FACTS ONLY in array values:**
      ❌ WRONG: "Purpose-built for embedded iPaaS — source: https://example.com"
      ❌ WRONG: "Purpose-built for embedded iPaaS (https://example.com)"
      ✅ RIGHT: "Purpose-built for embedded iPaaS serving B2B SaaS companies"
      
      **Put ALL source URLs in the citations field:**
      - Collect all URLs referenced during analysis
      - Add them to the citations array field
      - Do NOT embed URLs inline in fact text
      
      This separation enables clean display of facts without citation clutter.

      📝 CITATION FORMAT - CLEAN FACTS ONLY:
      
      ❌ WRONG: "Purpose-built for iPaaS — see https://example.com"
      ❌ WRONG: "High satisfaction (source: https://g2.com/review)"
      ❌ WRONG: "Market leader — multiple pages confirm this (url1, url2)"
      
      ✅ CORRECT: "Purpose-built for embedded iPaaS serving B2B SaaS"
      ✅ CORRECT: "High customer satisfaction with G2 Leader recognition"
      ✅ CORRECT: "Market leader in embedded integration platforms"
      
      **RULES:**
      - Array values = CLEAN FACTS only (no URLs, no "see:", no em dashes)
      - ALL source URLs go in the `citations` field as a separate array
      - Each array item should be self-contained and readable
      - Keep items concise: 50-100 characters max
