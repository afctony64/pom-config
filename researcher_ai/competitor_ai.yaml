# Semantic search queries for page selection (BM25/vector injectors)
# Issue #384: Multiple queries for comprehensive Page_facts coverage
search_queries:
  - "How does this product compare to competitors?"
  - "What alternatives exist and what differentiates them?"
  - "What customer reviews and market positioning exist?"

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)
tools:
  - brave_search  # Web search for competitor analysis, G2/Capterra reviews

    when_to_use: |
      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators
      
    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"
      
      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"

      🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      - Return ALL responses as valid JSON
      - Use arrays for lists
      - Keep descriptions concise (50-100 chars max)
      - Focus on facts, not prose
      - Maximum 5 items per category

      📊 FIELD POPULATION REQUIREMENTS:
      
      **1️⃣ ENTITY-LEVEL ARRAYS** (describe THIS company overall - REQUIRED):
      
      ✅ differentiationFactors: 3-5 items
         What makes THIS entity unique vs ALL competitors?
         Example: ["White-labeled marketplace", "Code-native SDK", "Embedded workflow builder"]
      
      ✅ competitiveAdvantages: 3-5 items  
         What advantages does THIS entity have in the market?
         Example: ["G2 Leader status", "Fastest time-to-market", "Best-in-class support"]
      
      ✅ competitiveThreats: 2-4 items
         What competitive threats is THIS entity facing?
         Example: ["Enterprise incumbents", "Low-cost alternatives", "In-house builds"]
      
      ✅ marketTrends: 2-4 items
         What market trends affect this competitive landscape?
         Example: ["Shift to embedded iPaaS", "API-first architecture"]
      
      **2️⃣ PARALLEL ARRAYS** (per-competitor data):
      Fields with parallel_to: keyCompetitors MUST have identical length.
      ALL of these MUST be populated for each competitor identified:
      - competitorDomain, competitorPositioning, competitorTargetMarket
      - competitorPriceVs, competitorAdvantagesVs, competitorGapsVs
      
      ⚠️ DO NOT leave array fields empty - they are key intelligence outputs!
      ⚠️ Use "Not disclosed" if data unavailable to maintain parallel alignment.
      
  parallel_arrays:
    priority: critical
    usage_instructions: |
      ⚠️ PARALLEL ARRAY ALIGNMENT:
      
      All fields with parallel_to: keyCompetitors MUST have identical length.
      Index [i] in one array corresponds to index [i] in all other arrays.
      
      RULES:
      - ALL parallel arrays MUST have IDENTICAL length (typically 3-5 competitors)
      - If data unavailable for a field, use "Not disclosed" to maintain alignment
      - DO NOT leave arrays with mismatched lengths
      - DO NOT leave any parallel array empty
      
      🚨 CRITICAL: For EVERY competitor in keyCompetitors:
      - You MUST find their domain (use web search if needed)
      - You MUST populate ALL parallel fields for that index
      - If domain truly cannot be found, use "Not disclosed" but maintain alignment

# Entity spawn configuration
# Spawn fields are auto-detected from schema via sets: [spawn] (pom-core#295)
# - Source field: text[] with spawn set and no parallel_to
# - Domain field: text[] with spawn set and parallel_to, name contains "domain"
# - Context fields: Other fields with spawn set and parallel_to
