# Anti-patterns to avoid (guides LLM away from common mistakes)
avoid:
  - Comparing to unrelated companies in completely different markets
  - Speculating on competitor strategy without evidence from sources
  - Including companies that serve different customer segments entirely
  - Using the company's own biased comparison pages as sole source
  - Listing more than 5 competitors (focus on most relevant)
  - Confusing technology partners with competitors

      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):

      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!

      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)

      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)

      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators

    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"

      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"
