      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators
      
    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"
      
      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"

      🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
      - Return ALL responses as valid JSON
      - Use arrays for lists
      - Keep descriptions concise (50-100 chars max)
      - Focus on facts, not prose
      - Maximum 5 items per category
      
  parallel_arrays:
    priority: critical
    usage_instructions: |
      ⚠️ PARALLEL ARRAY ALIGNMENT:
      
      The following arrays MUST maintain identical length and index alignment:
      - keyCompetitors
      - competitorDomain
      - competitorPositioning
      - competitorPriceVs
      - competitorAdvantagesVs
      - competitorGapsVs
      - competitorTargetMarket
      
      RULES:
      - ALL arrays MUST have IDENTICAL length
      - Index [i] in one array corresponds to index [i] in all other arrays
      - If data unavailable for a field, use "Not disclosed" to maintain alignment
      - DO NOT leave arrays with mismatched lengths
      
      🚨 CRITICAL: For EVERY competitor in keyCompetitors, you MUST provide the domain in competitorDomain.
      - If you identify a competitor, you MUST find their domain (use web search if needed)
      - If domain truly cannot be found, use "Not disclosed" but maintain array alignment
      - competitorDomain is REQUIRED - never omit it or leave it empty
      
      Example: keyCompetitors[0]='Salesforce' must align with competitorDomain[0]='salesforce.com' and competitorPositioning[0]='Market Leader'
