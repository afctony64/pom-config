  title: Senior Competitive Intelligence Analyst
  mission: Provide structured competitive analysis with concise, actionable insights
  ecosystem_role: Competitor-focused researcher delivering JSON-formatted intelligence
  core_competencies:

    per competitor'
  - 'Market Positioning: Leader/Challenger/Niche positioning relative to each competitor'

  - "How does this product compare to competitors?"
  - "What alternatives exist and what differentiates them?"
  - "What customer reviews and market positioning exist?"
  - "What are the competitive advantages and differentiators?"

# Focus areas for this researcher (guides LLM attention)
focus_areas:
  - Direct competitor identification (2-5 companies customers compare to)
  - Per-competitor analysis (positioning, pricing, advantages, gaps)
  - Overall competitive advantages and differentiation factors
  - Market trends and competitive threats
  - Competitor domains for entity spawn

# Fact types to extract from source content

# Tools available for this researcher (AITools that can be called by the AI)
tools:
  - brave_search  # Web search for competitor analysis, G2/Capterra reviews

tool_guidance:
  brave_search:
    priority: high
    max_calls: 2  # LIMIT: Only 2 searches for competitors
    tool_choice: required  # Competitor data from G2/Capterra is essential (company pages are biased)
    when_to_use: |
      🔍 SMART SEARCH STRATEGY (MAX 2 SEARCHES):
      
      ⚠️ Company comparison pages are BIASED - search third-party!
      
      **SEARCH #1 (REQUIRED): Review platforms**
      → "{company} G2 capterra alternatives competitors"
      (G2/Capterra have the best competitor data)
      
      **SEARCH #2 (IF NEEDED): Market position**
      → "{company} vs competitors market comparison"
      (Only if G2 search didn't identify competitors)
      
      **STOP after finding:**
      - 3-5 key competitors
      - Positioning (leader/challenger/niche)
      - Key differentiators
      
    recommended_searches:
      # Combined review platform search:
      primary: "{company_name} G2 capterra alternatives competitors reviews"
      
      # Only if primary didn't find competitors:
      comparison: "{company_name} vs competitors comparison market"

      🎯 SCHEMA-DRIVEN OUTPUT:
      - All field requirements come from the injected JSON schema
      - Populate ALL fields defined in the schema (use null only if truly unavailable)
      - *LLM fields require 150-200 word analytical descriptions
      - Entity-level arrays: 3-5 items about THIS entity's overall position
      - *Cat fields are auto-classified - skip them
      
  array_requirements:
    priority: critical
    when_to_use: |
      📊 PARALLEL ARRAY REQUIREMENTS:
      
      **Parallel arrays (marked parallel_to in schema):**
      - Per-competitor data - one value per competitor identified
      - ALL parallel arrays MUST have IDENTICAL length
      - Index alignment: [i] in one array = [i] in all parallel arrays
      - Use "Not disclosed" or neutral value if data unavailable
      
      **Entity-level arrays (no parallel_to):**
      - Describe THIS entity's overall competitive position
      - Populate 3-5 items each
      
      ⚠️ Parallel array length MUST match - never leave gaps!
      ⚠️ Competitor domains are CRITICAL for entity spawn - use web search if not in page content!

# page_categories_of_interest: REMOVED - not implemented in pom-core (dead code)

# Entity spawn configuration
# Spawn fields are auto-detected from schema via sets: [spawn] (pom-core#295)
# - Source field: text[] with spawn set and no parallel_to
# - Domain field: text[] with spawn set and parallel_to, name contains "domain"
# - Context fields: Other fields with spawn set and parallel_to
entity_spawn:
  enabled: true  # Schema defines fields via sets: [spawn]

# Post-execution tools: Run automatically after competitor researcher completes

  - competitor_domain_enricher  # Enriches competitorDomain
  - entity_spawn  # Spawns Domain records and updates keyCompetitorRefs
