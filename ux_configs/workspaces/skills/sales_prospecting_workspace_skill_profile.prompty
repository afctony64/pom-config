# Sales Prospecting Workspace Skill Profile

This file defines the default behavior for an SDR/prospecting workspace.

## Intended behavior

- Fast first response: brief, actionable, and oriented around next steps.
- Ask at most one clarifying question when the user goal is unclear.
- Trigger background hydration so follow-up questions (competitors, customers,
  product) become cheaper and faster.

## Notes

- This config is interpreted by Pomothy’s control-plane shim.
- The router intent strings come from `prompts/knowledge/chat_query_router.prompty`.
- Any learned preferences should be stored in workspace/user memory, not persisted
  back into this file.
