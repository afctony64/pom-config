description: >
  Fetch Research_competitor records with Domain reference.
  Starts from Research_competitor and traverses to Domain.
  Fast, focused data card for competitor dossier testing.

  overview: |
    Single-researcher data card for fast competitor intelligence testing.
    
    KEY INSIGHT: Starts from Research_competitor (not Domain) so that
    relationship traversal only brings in Domain, not all other researchers.
    
    FIELD SET BEHAVIOR:
    - standard: Core fields (Cat, key scalars, core parallel arrays)
    - extended: Deep-dive fields (LLM analysis, detailed arrays, scores)
    - array: All array fields (required for parallel array tables)
    
    USAGE:
    - Use [standard, array] for focused reports with key parallel arrays
    - Use [standard, extended, array] for full deep-dive
