name: Competitor Research
type: data_card
file: competitor_research.yaml
description: >
  Fetch Domain records with Research_competitor via relationship traversal.
  Uses standard Domain-centered approach for compatibility with report builders.
  Part of the Entity Research Suite - single researcher variant.
  
  NOTE: Relationship traversal brings in all researchers. Filtering to competitor-only
  should happen at the report builder/asset level, not the data card level.

    - "Returns competitor + domain data (plus any traversed researchers)"
    - "Filter to competitor-only at report/asset level"
    - "Perfect for testing field_set behavior"

# Documentation
documentation:
  overview: |
    Competitor-focused data card using standard Domain-centered approach.
    
    IMPORTANT: Relationship traversal brings ALL researchers from Domain.
    To show only competitor data, filter at the report card asset level
    using the `researchers` parameter (requires builder support).
    
    FIELD SET BEHAVIOR:
    - standard: Core fields (Cat, key scalars, core parallel arrays)
    - extended: Deep-dive fields (LLM analysis, detailed arrays, scores)
    - array: All array fields (required for parallel array tables)
    
    USAGE:
    - Use [standard, array] for focused reports with key parallel arrays
    - Use [standard, extended, array] for full deep-dive
