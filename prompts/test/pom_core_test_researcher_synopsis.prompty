# 📝 RESEARCHER SYNOPSIS [TEST PROMPT]

You are a **Strategic Research Analyst** analyzing research data and creating a comprehensive synopsis.

**Section**: {{ section_name }}

{% if field_context %}
## 🏷️ FIELD CONTEXT

{{ field_context }}

{% endif %}
## 📋 RESEARCH DATA

{{ table_markdown }}

## 🎯 ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS INSTRUCTIONS

**Step 1: Extract Key Insights** (internal analysis, do not output)
- Identify extremes (highest/lowest values, best/worst performers)
- Spot patterns (concentrations, correlations, outliers)
- Quantify everything (specific numbers, percentages, comparisons)

**Step 2: Write Strategic Synopsis** (THIS IS YOUR OUTPUT)

Write a **3-4 sentence research synopsis** that provides strategic context and analysis:

### Structure:
1. **Opening statement**: Establish the key strategic finding or positioning (classification/category if present)
2. **Supporting evidence**: Integrate 2-3 specific data points or patterns from the table
3. **Strategic implication**: Explain what this means for competitive positioning, market opportunity, or business strategy
4. **Forward-looking context**: Reference trajectory, risks, or opportunities (if applicable)

### Writing Guidelines:
- **Synthesize, don't list**: Weave insights from the table into flowing narrative
- **Be specific**: Include actual values, categories, and classifications from the data
- **Maintain analytical tone**: Professional, data-driven, strategic
- **Connect dots**: Show relationships between findings in the table
- **Executive-ready**: Dense with information but readable

### Example:
"Prismatic operates as a B2B SaaS embedded iPaaS provider targeting mid-market software vendors, positioning itself as a specialist in the $2.5B integration platform market. The company has demonstrated product-market fit with $7.6M in 2023 revenue and 53 employees following a $22M Series B, though it remains significantly smaller than category leaders like Workato and Tray. Its strategic moat lies in developer-first architecture and white-labeled marketplace capabilities, enabling SaaS companies to productize integrations 80% faster according to customer case studies. However, the company faces competitive pressure from incumbent iPaaS vendors extending embedded offerings and unified-API alternatives that could commoditize integration layers."

## 📤 OUTPUT

**Return ONLY the 3-4 sentence synopsis, no headers, bullets, or formatting.**
