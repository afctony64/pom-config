# ✅ KEY DESIGN FEATURE: Prompt template declares what OTHER PROMPT TEMPLATES it depends on
# This is declarative and "in reverse" - the prompt says what it needs
# PomFlow can then find all components using those prompt templates and execute them first

## Your Task

{% if not prior_prompt_results and not (industry_analysis or customer_analysis or product_analysis or competitor_analysis or financial_analysis or partner_analysis or leadership_analysis or risk_analysis or social_analysis or journalist_analysis) %}
**Note:** Limited analysis data is available for this company. Create a brief executive summary (2-3 paragraphs, 150-250 words) based on the company name and domain:

1. **Company Overview**: Who they are based on their name and domain
2. **Market Context**: What industry/sector they likely operate in
3. **General Assessment**: Note that detailed research analysis would be needed for comprehensive insights
{% else %}
Create a **concise executive summary** (3-5 paragraphs, 200-400 words) that:

1. **Opens with Company Positioning**: Who they are, what they do, and their market position
2. **Synthesizes Key Insights**: Integrate the most important findings from across all research areas
3. **Highlights Strategic Factors**: Key strengths, opportunities, risks, or competitive advantages
4. **Concludes with Overall Assessment**: High-level perspective on the company's trajectory
{% endif %}

**Requirements:**
- Write in clear, professional business language
- Focus on actionable insights, not just facts
{% if prior_prompt_results or (industry_analysis or customer_analysis or product_analysis or competitor_analysis or financial_analysis or partner_analysis or leadership_analysis or risk_analysis or social_analysis or journalist_analysis) %}
- Connect insights across research areas (e.g., how product strategy relates to competitive position)
- Be balanced - include both positive and concerning findings
- Use specific details from the research to support conclusions
{% endif %}

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**

**Format Specification:**
- **Output Type**: Plain text only (no HTML tags, no markdown syntax)
- **Structure**: Standard paragraph format (not bullets, not numbered lists)
- **Tone**: Professional, executive-ready language
- **Length**: 3-5 paragraphs, 200-400 words total

**STRICT FORMATTING RULES:**
1. **NO HTML TAGS**: Do not use `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<br />`, or any HTML markup
2. **NO MARKDOWN SYNTAX**: Do not use `**bold**`, `## headers`, `* bullets`, or any markdown formatting
3. **NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS**: Do not use `**`, `##`, `*`, ```` `, or other markdown indicators
4. **PLAIN TEXT ONLY**: Write natural paragraphs with proper capitalization and punctuation

**Example of CORRECT format:**
```
Prismatic is a B2B SaaS embedded iPaaS provider targeting mid-market software vendors. The company operates in the integration platform market, positioning itself as a specialist solution for SaaS companies that need to embed integration capabilities directly into their products. Prismatic has demonstrated product-market fit with strong customer adoption and recognition in industry awards.

The company's strategic advantage lies in its developer-first architecture and white-labeled marketplace capabilities. This enables SaaS companies to productize integrations significantly faster than building custom solutions, reducing engineering overhead while improving time-to-market for integration features. Customer case studies demonstrate measurable improvements in integration delivery speed and reduced support burden.

However, Prismatic faces competitive pressure from larger iPaaS vendors extending embedded offerings and unified-API alternatives. The company must continue innovating in developer experience and marketplace capabilities to maintain differentiation in an increasingly crowded market.
```

**Example of INCORRECT format (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>**Prismatic** is a B2B SaaS...</p>
## Key Findings
* Product-market fit
* Strong customer adoption
```

**REMEMBER**: Your output will be automatically converted to HTML. Write plain text paragraphs only.

---

**FINAL REMINDER**: Output plain text paragraphs only. No HTML tags (`<h2>`, `<p>`, etc.). No markdown syntax (`**`, `##`, `*`, etc.). Just natural, professional paragraphs that will be automatically formatted.
