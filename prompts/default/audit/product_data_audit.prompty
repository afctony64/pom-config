## Your Analysis

Please provide:

### 1. Critical Issues (Blocking)
Identify fields with 0% or very low coverage that need immediate attention.

### 2. Data Quality Patterns
What patterns do you see? Are certain field types consistently missing?

### 3. Root Cause Hypothesis
Based on the patterns, what might be causing the gaps?

### 4. Recommended Actions
Specific commands or steps to fix the issues, prioritized by impact:
- Which prompts/tools to run
- Expected improvement
- Estimated effort

### 5. Quality Score
Rate overall data readiness (1-10) with justification.

Be specific and actionable. Reference actual field names and percentages.
