# Avoid Large Output and Log Streaming

- Do not stream logs or read large files.
- Read at most 50-200 lines from any log or file when needed.
- Prefer summaries and final outcomes over progress updates.
- Use small, bounded searches (e.g., head limits).
- Avoid repeated polling unless explicitly requested.
