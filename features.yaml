# Feature flags (placeholder)
#
# This file is intentionally non-breaking: apps may choose to read it, but no
# runtime is required to. Treat it as documentation + a future shared contract.
#
# Rules:
# - Keep defaults conservative (avoid enabling high-cost behavior globally).
# - Do not put secrets here.
# - Prefer adding new flags over reinterpreting existing ones.
#
