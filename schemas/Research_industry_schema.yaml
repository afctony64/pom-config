    Address these elements:
    1. What they do - their primary activity or offering (be specific, not generic)
    2. Who they serve - target customers/clients and their characteristics
    3. How they operate - their approach or model for delivering value
    4. Segment-defining characteristics - what places them in one segment vs adjacent ones

    Use specific terminology that would appear in industry publications.
    Avoid generic terms like "provides solutions" or "offers services."

    START with the primary delivery mechanism:

    - Does it involve physical hardware or is it software-only?

    - Is infrastructure cloud-hosted, customer-hosted, or shared?

    - How do customers access it (browser, mobile, API, physical device)?


    Then briefly note deployment approach and key service delivery characteristics.
