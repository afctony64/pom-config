    - "high": Extracted from pageData that is AVAILABLE and RELEVANT (PRIMARY SOURCE - authoritative)

    - "medium": Based on indirect evidence or partial information
    - "low": Limited information, educated guesses
    - "inferred": No direct evidence, purely analytical inference

    Use "high" when pageData is available and relevant, "web_verified" when web_search confirms facts, or "llm_knowledge" when you have strong training knowledge about well-known entities.

    - "needs_verification": Low confidence or pure inference, human review required

    If analysisConfidence is "high", "web_verified", OR "llm_knowledge", use "none" - these sources are reliable.
