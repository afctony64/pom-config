description: "\U0001F4DA RESEARCH REPOSITORY: Competitive Ecosystem Intelligence (Lookalike\
  \ Entity Discovery)\n  \n  RESEARCHER: Competitive Intelligence Analyst (identity\
  \ defined in seed data for researcher identity)\n  \n  KNOWLEDGE TYPE: Ecosystem\
  \ of DIRECT COMPETITORS as lookalike prospects for the tenant's sales team\n  \n\
  \  PURPOSE: Build a seed list of entities with similar offerings in similar markets:\n\
  \  - Identify entities that COMPETE WITH this entity (not against the tenant)\n\
  \  - Map the competitive ecosystem to find lookalike prospects\n  - Generate high-quality\
  \ prospect lists based on similarity\n  - Enable efficient \"land and expand\" prospecting\
  \ strategies\n  \n  MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE: Each tenant represents one entity's\
  \ complete competitor intelligence\n  - Tenant Isolation: Complete data separation\
  \ per entity\n  - Tenant Activation: Automatic tenant creation and activation\n\
  \  - Scalability: Supports unlimited tenants with efficient partitioning\n  \n \
  \ REPOSITORY CONTENTS:\n  - Competitive Ecosystem Map: Named competitors with similar\
  \ offerings/markets\n  - Similarity Analysis: What makes these entities comparable\n\
  \  - Categorical Classifications: Machine-assigned categories for competitor attributes\n\
  \  - Quality Metadata: Processing dates, source quality, review flags, confidence\
  \ levels\n  - Evidence Links: References to supporting data and source materials\n\
  \  \n  DATA SOURCES:\n  - AI-analyzed entity websites and competitor-specific content\n\
  \  - Industry reports and research publications\n  - Public entity information and\
  \ disclosures\n  - Validated against authoritative sources when available\n  \n\
  \  QUALITY STANDARDS:\n  - Confidence Scoring: High, Medium, Low, Inferred, Web-verified\n\
  \  - Evidence-Based Assessment: Classifications backed by concrete evidence\n  -\
  \ Source Tracking: Links to originating Domain records\n  - Conservative Calibration:\
  \ Prefer 'unknown' over incorrect data\n  \n  INTEGRATION: Seeds prospect lists\
  \ by identifying lookalike entities in the same competitive ecosystem\n  \n  VECTOR\
  \ SEARCH CAPABILITIES: Named vectors for similarity search across key competitor\
  \ dimensions for lookalike discovery"
